# Serverpod Admin Portal Client

This is the **Dart client library** for the Admin Portal, generated by Serverpod. It enables your Flutter or Dart applications to communicate with the Serverpod backend.

---

## ✨ Features
- Auto-generated API client for Serverpod endpoints
- Type-safe data models and serialization
- Handles authentication and session management
- Supports custom modules and endpoints

---

## 🛠 Requirements
- Dart 3.7+
- Compatible with Flutter and pure Dart projects
- Serverpod backend running (see server README)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Add as a dependency
Add this package to your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  serverpod_admin_portal_client:
    path: ../serverpod_admin_portal_client
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
dart pub get
# or
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Initialize the client in your app
```dart
import 'package:serverpod_admin_portal_client/serverpod_admin_portal_client.dart';

final client = Client('http://localhost:8080/');
```

## ⚙️ Configuration
- Update the API endpoint URL to match your backend server
- For authentication/session, see Serverpod documentation
- Supports custom modules: add imports and update the client constructor as needed

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- `lib/` – Generated client code
- `lib/src/` – Internal implementation
- `lib/protocol/` – Data models and protocol definitions

---

## 🧪 Testing
- To run tests (if any):
```bash
dart test
```
- Add your tests in the `test/` directory

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
- Ensure the backend server is running and reachable
- Regenerate the client if you update your server endpoints/models:
```bash
serverpod generate
```
